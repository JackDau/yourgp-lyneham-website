Reviewed Aug 2023<br />
Introduction<br />
This privacy policy is to provide information to you, our patient, on how your personal information (which includes your health information) is collected and used within our practice, and the circumstances in which we may share it with third parties.<br />
Why and when your consent is necessary<br />
When you register as a patient, you provide consent for the GPs and practice staff to access and use your personal information so they can provide you with the best possible healthcare. Only staff and clinicians who need to see your personal information will access it. If we need to use your information for anything else, we will seek additional consent from you to do this.<br />
Why do we collect, use, hold and share your personal information?<br />
The practice will need to collect your personal information so the GPs can provide healthcare services to you. The main purpose for collecting, using, holding and sharing your personal information is to manage your health. It will also be used for related business activities, such as financial claims and payments, practice audits and accreditation, and business processes (eg staff training).<br />
What personal information do we collect?<br />
The information collected about you includes:<br />
•	names, date of birth, addresses, contact details<br />
•	medical information including medical history, medications, allergies, adverse events, immunisations, social history, family history and risk factors<br />
•	Medicare number (where available) for identification and claiming purposes<br />
•	healthcare identifiers<br />
Dealing with us anonymously<br />
You have the right to deal with your GP and the practice anonymously or under a pseudonym, unless it is not practical for us to do so, or unless required or authorised by law to only deal with identified individuals.<br />
How do we collect your personal information?<br />
The practice will collect your personal information:<br />
1.	When you make your first appointment, practice staff will collect your personal and demographic information via your registration.<br />
2.	During the course of providing medical services, we may collect further personal information through Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (eTP), MyHealth Record/PCEHR system, eg via Shared Health Summary, Event Summary.<br />
We may also collect your personal information when you send us an email, telephone us, make an online appointment or communicate with us using social media.<br />
3.	In some circumstances personal information may also be collected from other sources. Often this is because it is not practical or reasonable to collect it from you directly. This may include information from:<br />
•	your guardian or responsible person<br />
•	other involved healthcare providers, such as specialists, allied health professionals, hospitals, community health services and pathology and diagnostic imaging services<br />
•	Medicare, or the Department of Veteran's Affairs (as necessary).<br />
Who do we share your personal information with?<br />
We sometimes share your personal information:<br />
•	with third parties who work with our practice for business purposes, such as accreditation agencies or information technology providers – these third parties are required to comply with Australian Privacy Principles and this policy<br />
•	with other healthcare providers<br />
•	when it is required or authorised by law (eg court subpoenas)<br />
•	when it is necessary to lessen, or prevent a serious threat to a patient’s life, health or safety or public health or safety, or it is impractical to obtain the patient’s consent<br />
•	to assist in locating a missing person<br />
•	to establish, exercise or defend an equitable claim<br />
•	for the purpose of confidential dispute resolution process<br />
•	when there is a statutory requirement to share certain personal information (eg some diseases require mandatory notification)<br />
•	during the course of providing medical services, through Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (eTP), MyHealth Record/PCEHR system (eg via Shared Health Summary, Event Summary). </p>
<p>Only people that need to access your information will do so. Other than in the course of providing medical services or as otherwise described in this policy, our practice will not share personal information with any third party without your consent.<br />
We will not share your personal information with anyone outside Australia (unless under exceptional circumstances that are permitted by law) without your consent.<br />
Our practice will not use your personal information for marketing any of our goods or services directly to you without your express consent. If you do consent, you may opt-out of direct marketing at any time by notifying our practice in writing.<br />
How do we store and protect your personal information?<br />
Your personal information will be stored at our practice primarily as electronic records.  We will store your paper records when they have been transferred by another practice.<br />
Our practice stores all personal information securely.<br />
We protect your personal information by:<br />
•	securely locking away paper files or scanning them into your electronic record<br />
•	highly secure and protected medical record IT systems<br />
•	confidentiality agreements for staff and contractors </p>
<p>How can you access and correct your personal information at our practice?<br />
You have the right to request access to, and correction of, your personal information.<br />
